Ideas for discord bot
-Hangman
    Bot creates graphical hangman in chat
    Bot self edits the message with the progress of the game
    Commands.
        !Hangman play
            Creates new hangman game in the chat and adds ping @hangman
            every game has own game ID
        !Hangman exit
        !Hangman plays
            Gives embeded plate in chat that shows,
                How many times hangman has been played
                How many differeny players have played
                How many total wins
                How many total losses
                If determined, can search game by its id
                    Every player that played on the determined game gets dm:ed about the game end
control panel for bots
Whilist bot running on server, can see console, used commands, errors, use commands?, etc
    When starting pc, or starting program, would get windows popups if error has occoured
    with control panel, could start and stop the bot
    Can see uptime of the box and uptime of the control panel session
